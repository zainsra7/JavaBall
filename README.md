# JavaBall
JavaBall project completed in 2 days as an entry level test for MSc Computing Science at Univerity of Glasgow'18. 
This test was conducted during Week 0, and based on the result of the test a student was either allowed to progress into CS+ programme
or a conversion IT/SD programme.

## Basic requirements:
1. List of all matches are generated for the tournament (from TeamsIn.txt).
2. A team is allowed to withdraw before the results are declared.
3. After the results are declared (from ResultsIn.txt), user can enter match-result for any results left.
4. Rank table is generated and teams are awarded with Gold, Silver and Bronze medal. Also the rank table is stored in an output file (ResultsOut.txt).
5. It should be a GUI application.

Following are the screenshots of the application:

# Note: 

I uploaded this code repo after the start of my second semester, and I took permission from my advisor and director of CS programme to upload it. 
I take no responsiblity if someone try to copy this in future for their assessment and I would strongly advice the students to try
and solve the entry level test on their own as it is for their own benefit.
Also, I have not shared the description or manual PDF of the test so it might hide the detailed requirements of the test.
